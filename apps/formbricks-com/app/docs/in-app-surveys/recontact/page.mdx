#### In-App Surveys

# Recontact Options

Recontact options in Formbricks enable you to manage how often and under what conditions a survey is shown to a user. This feature is crucial for balancing effective feedback collection with a positive user experience by preventing survey fatigue.

## When do Recontact Options come into play?

Recontact options are applicable under the following conditions:

- A survey is **already triggered** based on user actions or other specified conditions.
- The user **qualifies for the survey again** if any targeting criteria are set.

If both conditions are met, the specified Recontact Options determine if and when the survey will be re-displayed to the user.

## Survey Recontact Options

<Note>By default, a survey is shown to a user only once.</Note>

You can adjust this behavior by modifying the Recontact Options in the survey settings:

1. Open the Survey Editor for the survey you want to see & modify the Recontact Options for.
2. Select the Settings Tab.
3. Ensure your Survey type is set to **App Survey**.

/>

4. Scroll down to the Recontact Options section.

Available Recontact Options include:

- **Show only once**: Displays the survey a single time, regardless of whether it was completed.
- **Until they Submit a Response**: Continuously shows the survey until the user submits a response. Ideal for critical feedback.
- **Keep Showing while Conditions Match**: Repeats the survey while specific conditions are met. Useful for continuous feedback collection, such as in [Docs Feedback Survey](/docs/best-practices/docs-feedback).

## Product-wide Global Waiting Time

<Note>
  The default interval between surveys for the same user across the product is set to 7 days to prevent
  over-surveying.
</Note>

To adjust the Global Waiting Time:

1. Visit Formbricks Settings
2. Go to Product Settings
3. Find the **Recontact Waiting Time** section
4. Modify the interval (in Days) as needed.

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Overriding Global Waiting Time for a Specific Survey

For specific surveys, you may need to override the default waiting time. Below is how you can do that:

1. In the Survey Editor, access the Settings Tab.
2. Find the Ignore Waiting Time between Surveys toggle under Recontact Options.
3. Enable this toggle to bypass the global setting.
4. Set a custom recontact period:
   - **Always Show Survey**: Displays the survey whenever triggered, ignoring the waiting time.
   - **Wait `X` days before showing this survey again**: Sets a specific interval before the survey can be shown again.

  src={IgnoreWaitTime}
  alt="Ignore Global Waiting Time for a Specific Survey"

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
